• About the Sales Data:

The data covers sales information starting from January 1, 2013. It includes important details like when sales occurred, who made the sales (identified by their names and special IDs), what products were sold, the quantity (although it's in a percentage format, which is a bit unusual), the price for each item, the total sales amount, and where these sales happened in different cities.

• Goal with this Data:

We're diving into this information to uncover interesting trends in sales. We want to see if there are connections between different aspects, such as whether selling more of a product leads to more revenue. By doing this, we hope to help the company make smarter decisions based on the insights we find.
